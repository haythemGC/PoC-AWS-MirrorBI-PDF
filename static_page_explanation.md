Great — I’ll walk through **every part** of that HTML page and explain what each line / block does, why it’s there, and what you should change in a real deployment. I **won’t** paste the whole file again (it’s in your canvas), but I’ll describe it in exact order so you can follow the file line-by-line.

If anything I explain is unclear, tell me which line number (or copy a short snippet) and I’ll explain that small piece even more.

---

# Top of file — document type and `<html>` metadata

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`

   * Declares the page is an **HTML5** document. It tells the browser how to parse and render the page.

2. `<html lang="en">`

   * Root element. `lang="en"` says the natural language is English (good for accessibility and search engines).

3. `<head>` … `</head>` block

   * The head contains metadata (information about the page, not visible content).

Inside the `<head>`:

4. `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`

   * Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 (supports international characters).

5. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`

   * Ensures the page scales correctly on mobile devices (responsive layout).

6. `<title>MirrorBI Upload</title>`

   * The page title shown in the browser tab.

7. `<script src="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-2.1487.0.min.js"></script>`

   * Loads the AWS JavaScript SDK v2 into the page. This makes the `AWS` global object available for interacting with AWS services (S3 used later).
   * **Important security note:** including and using the AWS SDK in the browser is fine **only** if you provide **temporary** limited credentials (e.g., via Cognito or temporary token), **not** permanent access keys. The later code has a hard-coded credentials example — that is insecure for production (I'll explain safer options later).

8. `<style>` … `</style>` block

   * Inline CSS styles for the page. It defines the look: fonts, card layout, margins, `.hidden` class (which hides an element), and `#resultBox` visuals and `white-space: pre-wrap` so JSON displays nicely with line breaks.

---

# Body content — visible UI

Inside `<body>`:

9. A container `<div class="card">`

   * Holds the visible UI elements, centered and styled by CSS.

10. `<h2>Upload PDF to MirrorBI</h2>`

    * Page heading visible to the user.

11. `<input type="file" id="fileInput" />`

    * File selector control. `type="file"` allows the user to pick a file from their computer.
    * In the version shown, there is no `accept` attribute, so any file type can be chosen; you can add `accept=".pdf,.csv"` to restrict types.

12. `<button onclick="uploadFile()">Upload</button>`

    * A button that, when clicked, calls the JavaScript function `uploadFile()` (defined later). The `onclick` attribute wires the button to that function.

13. `<div id="status"></div>`

    * Empty element where the script writes status messages (e.g., “Uploading…”, “Processing…”, or error messages).

14. `<div id="resultBox" class="hidden"></div>`

    * Element for showing the resulting JSON when processing completes. It starts hidden (`class="hidden"` sets `display:none`). The script removes that class when there is a result and inserts the JSON text inside.

# The JavaScript — behavior and AWS calls

All the behavior happens inside the `<script>` near the bottom. I’ll explain in order.

### AWS configuration

15. `AWS.config.update({ region: "us-east-1", credentials: new AWS.Credentials({ accessKeyId: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" }) });`

    * This configures the AWS SDK with:

      * `region`: AWS region where your S3 bucket lives. Must match the bucket region.
      * `credentials`: **permanent** access key & secret in this example (bad for production). These credentials allow the browser to sign requests to S3.
    * **Why this is dangerous:** Putting long-lived access keys in client-side JavaScript exposes them to anyone who views the page source → attacker could use them to access your AWS resources. You should instead use **temporary credentials** (Cognito Identity Pool / STS) or server-side-generated **pre-signed URLs**.
    * If you use temporary credentials the SDK code looks slightly different (you still set AWS.config with a credentials provider).

16. `const s3 = new AWS.S3({ apiVersion: "2006-03-01" });`

    * Creates an S3 client object that lets you call `putObject` and `getObject` from the browser via the SDK.

17. `const bucketName = "your-bucket-name"; const uploadPrefix = "uploads/"; const resultPrefix = "results/";`

    * `bucketName`: name of your S3 bucket. Replace with the actual bucket.
    * `uploadPrefix`: the key prefix (like a folder) for user uploads. In your setup Lambda is triggered on `uploads/`.
    * `resultPrefix`: where Lambda writes the analysis JSON, e.g. `results/filename.json`.

### uploadFile() function

18. `async function uploadFile() { ... }`

    * Declares an asynchronous function to handle the upload when user clicks the button.

Inside `uploadFile()`:

19. `const fileInput = document.getElementById("fileInput");`

    * Get the file input element from the DOM.

20. `if (!fileInput.files.length) { alert("Please select a file first."); return; }`

    * If no file selected, show an alert and stop.

21. `const file = fileInput.files[0];`

    * Grab the first (and usually only) selected file.

22. `const uploadKey = uploadPrefix + file.name;`

    * Build S3 object key for upload, e.g. `uploads/myfile.pdf`. This is the path S3 uses.

23. `const resultKey = resultPrefix + file.name.replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, "") + ".json";`

    * Build the expected result key. It:

      * Takes the filename (`file.name`), strips any file extension using a regex (`replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, "")`), then adds `.json`.
      * So `myfile.pdf` → `results/myfile.json`. This must match how your Lambda names the output JSON.

24. `document.getElementById("status").innerText = "Uploading...";`

    * Update UI so the user knows the upload has started.

25. `await s3.putObject({ Bucket: bucketName, Key: uploadKey, Body: file, ContentType: file.type }).promise();`

    * Uploads the file **directly from the browser** to S3:

      * `Bucket`: the bucket name.
      * `Key`: the path (uploadKey).
      * `Body`: the file binary (browser `File` object).
      * `ContentType`: MIME type, e.g., `application/pdf`. `file.type` is set by the browser when possible.
    * `.promise()` converts the AWS Request into a JavaScript Promise so `await` works.
    * If this succeeds, S3 now contains the uploaded file and — if you've configured S3 event notifications — the upload will trigger your Lambda.

26. `document.getElementById("status").innerText = "File uploaded! Processing...";`

    * Update UI after successful upload.

27. `pollForResult(resultKey);`

    * Starts polling (periodic checks) for the analysis JSON object in `results/`.

28. `catch` block: logs error and shows status — standard error handling for upload failures (bad credentials, CORS, network errors, permission denied).

### pollForResult() function

29. `async function pollForResult(resultKey) { let attempts = 0; const maxAttempts = 20; const interval = 5000; ... }`

    * Tries repeatedly to `getObject` from S3 to see when Lambda has written the JSON.
    * `maxAttempts = 20` and `interval = 5000` mean it polls up to 20 times every 5 seconds → about 100 seconds total before giving up.

30. `const check = async () => { attempts++; try { const data = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: bucketName, Key: resultKey }).promise(); ... } catch(err) { if (err.code === "NoSuchKey" && attempts < maxAttempts) { setTimeout(check, interval); } else { document.getElementById("status").innerText = "No result found yet. Try again later."; } } }; check();`

    * `s3.getObject(...)`: attempts to download the result JSON from S3.
    * Success path:

      * `data.Body` is binary content of the object. The code decodes it and displays in the `resultBox`.
      * `new TextDecoder("utf-8").decode(data.Body)` decodes the binary into a text string (JSON string).
      * The `resultBox` is made visible and filled with the text, and `status` updated to success.
    * Error path:

      * If S3 responds with `NoSuchKey` (file doesn't exist yet), it sets a timeout and retries until `maxAttempts` is reached.
      * If other errors happen or maxAttempts reached, it writes “No result found yet. Try again later.” (could be permission error, CORS, or Lambda failed).

# Important operational & security details (do not skip)

You must not deploy the example exactly as-is to production. Important items:

### 1) **Never embed long-lived AWS access keys in client-side JS**

* The lines that set `new AWS.Credentials({ accessKeyId: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" })` are only okay for testing in a private environment. If you publish this page, anyone can view source and steal keys.
* **Secure alternatives:**

  * **Pre-signed PUT URL** (recommended): Your backend (server or Lambda behind API Gateway) *creates a pre-signed PUT URL* and returns it to the client. The browser then uploads with a `fetch(uploadUrl, { method: 'PUT', body: file })`. No credentials in browser required. Lambda triggering and pipeline remains the same.
  * **Cognito Identity Pools**: Configure Cognito to provide temporary, limited credentials (with permissions only to `uploads/*` and read for `results/*`), then use the AWS SDK in-browser safely.
  * **Backend upload proxy**: send file to your backend; backend stores in S3 and returns the result URL.

### 2) **S3 CORS**

* For browser PUT/GET to work you must set the S3 bucket CORS configuration to allow your static site origin and allow methods `PUT`, `GET`, `HEAD`, and required headers. Example JSON CORS (replace `https://your-site.example` with your site origin):

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-site.example"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET", "HEAD", "POST"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

* Without CORS properly configured, browser requests to S3 will fail even if credentials are correct.

### 3) **IAM permissions**

* The credentials used by the page must be restricted. Minimal permissions:

  * Allow `s3:PutObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/uploads/*`
  * Allow `s3:GetObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/results/*`
* Example minimal IAM policy (JSON):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/uploads/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/results/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

* If using pre-signed URLs, the backend that generates the URL must have `s3:PutObject` permission; the browser does not need credentials at all.

### 4) **Naming and prefix convention must match Lambda**

* The `uploadPrefix` and `resultPrefix` must match what your Lambda expects and what triggers it. For example, if Lambda triggers on `uploads/` and writes results to `results/`, the page must use the same prefixes and the Lambda must name the file the same way (i.e., `results/<original-name-without-ext>.json`).

### 5) **Polling vs push notification**

* Polling is simple but wasteful. If you want real-time updates and avoid repeated GETs, consider:

  * Have Lambda publish a message to an SNS topic or SQS queue and your backend notify the client (via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events).
  * OR have your backend provide an API `GET /status/<fileid>` that returns `processing | done` and the result URL.

# Debugging tips if something fails

* **Open Browser DevTools → Network tab** and watch the PUT to S3 and subsequent GET requests. Look for:

  * HTTP status codes (403 = permission denied, 400 = bad request, CORS errors appear in console).
  * Request headers (Content-Type) — some CORS setups require `Content-Type` to be whitelisted.
* **Check S3 object listing in the console** to confirm file exists under `uploads/`.
* **CloudWatch logs** for your Lambda: see if it was triggered and whether it wrote a file to `results/`.
* **Verify CORS**: look at response headers `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
* **Check region**: The `region` value in SDK must match the bucket region.

---

# Quick recommended change (most secure, minimal code change)

**Use pre-signed URLs.** Instead of storing credentials in page, do this flow:

1. Browser: POST `/get-presigned` with `{ filename }`.
2. Backend: generate a pre-signed PUT URL for `uploads/filename` and a pre-signed GET URL for `results/<name>.json` (or return the result-key and let the browser build the expected result URL).
3. Browser: `await fetch(uploadUrl, { method:'PUT', body: file });`
4. Browser: poll `resultUrl` (no credentials required).

* This keeps your keys on the server and gives minimal access.

If you want, I can now:

* Show an example **server endpoint** (NodeJS or Python boto3) that returns presigned URLs, or
* Replace your current page in the canvas with a **presigned-URL version** of the JS (removes AWS credentials and uses `fetch` PUT).

Which one do you want next?
