## 🧠 1. When you use **Claude Sonnet 4.0** via **AWS Bedrock**

You are **not sending data to Anthropic’s public servers**.
Instead, AWS Bedrock acts as the **secure intermediary** — here’s how it works:

* Your requests go from your AWS account → to **Bedrock’s managed API** → to **Claude (hosted inside AWS infrastructure)**.
* Anthropic **does not have direct access** to your data or AWS account.
* **Data never leaves AWS’s secure environment.**

✅ **So yes — it’s secure by AWS standards.**

---

## 🔒 2. What happens to your data

According to **AWS Bedrock’s security policy** (and Anthropic’s under Bedrock):

* **Your prompts and outputs are *not* used for model training.**
* **Your data stays private** inside your AWS account.
* AWS automatically applies **encryption at rest (KMS)** and **encryption in transit (TLS)**.
* Bedrock complies with **ISO, SOC, and GDPR** standards.

👉 That means if you send *sensitive business data* (like client reports, invoices, or company KPIs) to Claude **through AWS Bedrock**, it remains **confidential** and **isn’t reused** by AWS or Anthropic.

## 🧰 3. About your “agent” (MirrorBI setup)

You’re building a workflow like this:

```
User → Web UI → Lambda → Bedrock (Claude) → S3 Result
```

That means:

* **You** control all AWS components (Lambda, S3, IAM).
* **Bedrock** only processes what your Lambda sends it.
* **Claude** inside Bedrock never shares or stores the data beyond your request.

✅ So your agent (Claude Sonnet 4.0 via AWS Bedrock) is **private and secure** within your AWS environment.
❌ It is *not* the same as using the public Claude chatbot (like on Anthropic’s or Poe’s website).

## ⚙️ 4. When you might need extra protection

If you handle **personal or confidential data (PII, HR, financial reports)**:

* Use **VPC endpoints for Bedrock**, so requests never leave AWS internal network.
* Enable **CloudTrail** to log all Bedrock API calls.
* Optionally, use **KMS encryption keys** to encrypt data before sending.
* Keep results in private S3 buckets with IAM restrictions.

Then you have **end-to-end privacy** — full compliance and auditability.
